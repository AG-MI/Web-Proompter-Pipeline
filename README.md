# Web-Proompter-Pipeline
A fun little project made during my participation at a hackathon

# Basic Idea
The theme for the hackathon was "making a website". 
So why not make a backend that reaches out to an LLM and has it create a new web each time someone visits? \
I might polish this idea at a later time.
